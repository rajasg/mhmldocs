What is Terminal?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Provides a command-line interface to the operating system which allows you to DIVE files and applications. Git commands are run on terminal.

or MacOC/Linux, terminal is pre-installed as an application.

For Windows, follow this setup tutorial provided on EECS 280 class: https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_wsl.html.

(Windows is a bit more nit-picky with terminal because it isn’t a Unix OS, but we shouldn’t have any problems with Git on the windows terminal)
